<h1>Generated Binary Search Tree (BST) 🌴</h1>
<hr />
<p>To explain how this works, each node is an object holding a <i>value,</i> and two branches: left & right. <br>
   If a node has no child on a particular side, it'll return as :null.</p>
<p>If a new number is smaller than its current node's value, it'll branch off to the left. However, if it's <br>
   larger, it veers to the right instead.</p>
<p>So in saying that, by inserting 37, 17, and 209 in that specific order you'll see that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>37 becomes the root.</li>
    <li>17 is less than 37 in this case, so it becomes the left child.</li>
    <li>209 is greater than 37, becoming the right child!</li>
</ul>
<p>An easy way to put it is that this structure makes searching for values easy, due to how every step the tree <br/>
   makes, it decides the direction to go (left for smaller, right for bigger!)</p>
<br />
<p>With all of that out of the way, this is the JSON representation of your tree 🍃:</p>
